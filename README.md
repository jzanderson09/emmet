1. This [video about Emmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8vizNQKtx0) showcases some of the ways we can use Emmet to enhance productivity. Go ahead and watch it up to 11:37 as it demonstrates some content we haven’t covered yet. We’ll get there eventually. 

2. Take a look at the [Emmet cheat sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/). You don’t have to memorize it, but it’s good that you get familiar with the different ways it can be used.
